# M365 Agent PowerShell Deployment Update

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary

Updated the M365 Agent tab to use **automated PowerShell deployment** instead of requiring users to manually run CLI commands. When users click "Deploy Now to M365", the system automatically executes a PowerShell script that handles the entire deployment process.

## ðŸ”„ What Changed

### 1. New PowerShell Deployment Method
- Added `deploy_to_m365_via_powershell()` method to `M365AgentManager`
- Uses subprocess to execute PowerShell script automatically
- Handles authentication with service principal credentials
- Installs MicrosoftTeams module automatically if needed
- Parses deployment results and provides detailed feedback

### 2. Enhanced UI Experience
- Updated "Deploy to M365" button to use PowerShell deployment
- Added clear progress indicators showing PowerShell execution
- Enhanced success messages explaining what happened
- Added PowerShell-specific troubleshooting tips
- Updated deployment instructions to emphasize one-click deployment

### 3. Cross-Platform Support
- Windows: Uses built-in `powershell.exe`
- macOS/Linux: Uses PowerShell Core (`pwsh`)
- Automatic detection of platform and PowerShell executable

### 4. Robust Error Handling

- Detailed error messages for common issues
- Timeout handling for network issues
- Proper cleanup of temporary script files

## ðŸš€ Key Benefits

1. **No Manual CLI Commands**: Users never need to leave the UI
2. **Automatic Module Installation**: MicrosoftTeams module installed if missing
3. **Real-time Feedback**: Progress and results shown in Streamlit interface
