Demonstration: SharePoint Change Tracking and Deletion Management

This script demonstrates the capabilities of the enhanced SharePoint system:
1. Current file deletion capabilities (using existing purger)
2. Proposed change tracking system
3. Integration patterns

Run this to understand how the system works.

Current SharePoint Deletion Capabilities:

✅ EXISTING FEATURES:
   • Async deletion purger (SharepointDeletedFilesPurger)
   • Queries Azure Search for SharePoint documents
   • Checks each file's existence in SharePoint via Graph API
   • Batch deletes orphaned documents from search index
   • Uses KeyVault for secure credential management
   • Comprehensive error handling and logging

🔧 HOW IT WORKS:
   1. Scans Azure Search for documents with source='sharepoint'
   2. For each document, checks if parent_id exists in SharePoint
   3. If file returns 404 (deleted), marks for removal
   4. Batch deletes orphaned documents (100 per batch)
   5. Reports deletion statistics

⚙️  CURRENT LIMITATIONS:
   • Runs independently (no integration with indexing flow)
   • Only handles deletions (no new/modified file detection)
   • No metadata persistence for efficient change tracking
   • Manual execution (no automated scheduling visible)

📋 EXAMPLE USAGE:
   ```python
   from connectors.sharepoint.sharepoint_deleted_files_purger import SharepointDeletedFilesPurger
   
   purger = SharepointDeletedFilesPurger()
   await purger.purge_deleted_files()
   ```

Proposed Enhanced Capabilities:

🆕 NEW FEATURES:
   • Persistent file metadata storage (SQLite database)
   • Comprehensive change detection (new, modified, deleted)
   • Integration with existing indexing pipeline
   • Incremental sync operations
   • Detailed sync history and reporting
   • Streamlit UI integration

📊 CHANGE DETECTION:
   • NEW FILES: Not in metadata database
   • MODIFIED FILES: Different etag or modified_datetime
   • DELETED FILES: In database but not in SharePoint
   • UNCHANGED FILES: Same etag and modified_datetime

🗄️  METADATA STORAGE:
   Database Schema:
   - file_metadata: id, name, path, parent_id, size, modified_datetime, 
                   etag, last_indexed_datetime, checksum, indexed_in_search
   - sync_history: sync_datetime, files_added, files_modified, 
                  files_deleted, duration, status, error_message

🔄 SYNC WORKFLOW:
   1. Get current SharePoint file list
   2. Compare with stored metadata
   3. Detect changes (new/modified/deleted)
   4. Process deletions (using existing purger)
   5. Index new/modified files
   6. Update metadata database
   7. Record sync operation

📈 BENEFITS:
   • Efficient incremental indexing
   • Automatic change detection
   • Historical sync tracking
   • Reduced API calls (only check changed files)
   • Better error handling and recovery

Integration with Existing Systems:

🏗️  ARCHITECTURE:
   
   Current Flow:
   SharePoint → SharePointIndexManager → Azure Search
   
   Enhanced Flow:
   SharePoint → ChangeTracker → IndexManager + Purger → Azure Search
                      ↓
                 Metadata DB

🔧 INTEGRATION POINTS:

   1. WITH EXISTING INDEX MANAGER:
      • Reuse chunking/embedding logic
      • Maintain schema compatibility
      • Preserve error handling patterns

   2. WITH EXISTING PURGER:
      • Keep existing deletion logic
      • Add metadata cleanup
      • Integrate with change detection

   3. WITH STREAMLIT UI:
      • Add change tracking dashboard
      • Show sync history
      • Enable manual sync operations

📝 IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:

   Phase 1: Basic Change Tracking
   • ✅ Create SharePointChangeTracker class
   • ✅ Implement metadata database
   • ✅ Add change detection logic

   Phase 2: Integration
   • 🔄 Integrate with existing index manager
   • 🔄 Connect with deletion purger
   • 🔄 Add Streamlit UI components

   Phase 3: Automation
   • ⏳ Add scheduled sync operations
   • ⏳ Implement webhook support
   • ⏳ Add monitoring and alerts

🚀 QUICK START:
   
   To enable change tracking in your app:
   
   ```python
   # In your main Streamlit app:
   from sharepoint_integration_example import add_integrated_sync_ui
   
   # Add to your SharePoint tab:
   add_integrated_sync_ui()
   ```

File Lifecycle in Enhanced System:

📁 NEW FILE ADDED TO SHAREPOINT:
   1. Detected during next sync scan
   2. Marked as 'new' in change detection
   3. Processed through indexing pipeline
   4. Metadata stored with indexed_in_search=True
   5. File now tracked for future changes

📝 FILE MODIFIED IN SHAREPOINT:
   1. ETag or modified_datetime changes
   2. Detected as 'modified' in change detection
   3. Re-indexed with new content
   4. Metadata updated with new timestamps
   5. Old index entries replaced

🗑️  FILE DELETED FROM SHAREPOINT:
   1. File no longer returned by SharePoint API
   2. Detected as 'deleted' in change detection
   3. Existing purger removes from search index
   4. Metadata removed from database
   5. File no longer tracked

🔄 FILE MOVED/RENAMED:
   1. Appears as deletion + new file
   2. Original path entry removed
   3. New path entry created
   4. Content re-indexed at new location

📊 TRACKING METRICS:
   • Total files tracked
   • Files successfully indexed
   • Files pending indexing
   • Recent sync operations
   • Error counts and types

🎯 RECOVERY SCENARIOS:
   • Partial sync failures: Resume from last successful state
   • Index corruption: Rebuild from metadata database
   • SharePoint outages: Retry with exponential backoff
   • Network issues: Queue operations for retry

To implement enhanced change tracking:

1. REVIEW THE PROVIDED FILES:
   • sharepoint_change_tracker.py - Core change tracking logic
   • sharepoint_integration_example.py - Integration patterns

2. ADAPT TO YOUR ENVIRONMENT:
   • Update SharePoint API calls to match your data reader
   • Integrate with your specific indexing methods
   • Customize database schema if needed

3. INTEGRATE WITH UI:
   • Add the provided UI components to your Streamlit app
   • Test with small folder sets first
   • Monitor performance with large file counts

4. OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
   • Add automated scheduling (cron jobs, Azure Functions)
   • Implement webhook support for real-time updates
   • Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting

The existing deletion purger is already functional and can be used
independently or integrated with the new change tracking system.
