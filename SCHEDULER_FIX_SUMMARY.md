# SharePoint Scheduler Auto-Start Fix Summary

## Issues Identified ✅

1. **Auto-Resume on App Start**: The scheduler was automatically resuming when the app restarted, using previously saved folder selections.

2. **Too Frequent Processing**: The scheduler was running every 1 minute, causing the same files to be reprocessed repeatedly.

3. **Persisted State**: The scheduler saved its state (including folder selections) and would restore it on restart, leading to unwanted automatic monitoring.

4. **No User Control**: Users couldn't prevent the scheduler from starting with old settings.

## Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. Disabled Auto-Resume
- **File**: `sharepoint_scheduler.py` 
- **Change**: Modified `_load_state()` method to not automatically resume the scheduler
- **Result**: Scheduler now stays stopped until user manually starts it

### 2. Improved Default Interval  
- **File**: `sharepoint_scheduler.py`
- **Change**: Changed default interval from 1 minute to 15 minutes
- **Result**: When users do start the scheduler, it won't overwhelm the system

### 3. Added Folder Validation
- **File**: `sharepoint_scheduler.py`
- **Change**: Added validation in `start_scheduler()` to ensure folders are explicitly selected
- **Result**: Scheduler cannot start without user-selected folders

### 4. Reset Scheduler State
- **Tool**: Created `reset_scheduler_state.py`
- **Action**: Cleared all persisted scheduler state
- **Result**: Fresh start with no old folder selections

## Configuration Overview

### Before Fix ❌
```
- Auto-resume: Enabled
- Default interval: 1 minute  
- Folder selection: Used old saved folders (/ppt)
- User control: Limited
```

### After Fix ✅  
```
- Auto-resume: Disabled
- Default interval: 15 minutes
- Folder selection: Must be explicitly chosen by user
- User control: Full control over when and what to monitor
```

## User Workflow Now

1. **Start App**: `streamlit run agentic-rag-demo.py`
2. **Go to SharePoint Tab**: Navigate to SharePoint management
3. **Select Folders**: Choose specific folders you want to monitor  
4. **Configure Scheduler**: Set interval and other preferences
5. **Start Manually**: Click "Start Scheduler" when ready

## Files Modified

1. `sharepoint_scheduler.py` - Core scheduler logic
2. `reset_scheduler_state.py` - One-time cleanup tool (created)
3. `scheduler_state.pkl` - State file (cleared)

## Notes

- The `.env` variable `SHAREPOINT_SITE_FOLDER=/ppt` is still there but only used by the indexer component itself, not for auto-starting the scheduler
- Old processing reports were preserved (user choice)
- The scheduler singleton pattern ensures consistent behavior across the app

## Testing

✅ Scheduler state has been cleared
✅ Auto-resume is disabled
✅ Folder validation is in place
✅ Default interval is reasonable (15 minutes)
✅ No syntax errors in modified files

The scheduler will now behave predictably and only monitor folders that the user explicitly selects in the UI.
