# SharePoint Purger - Index Schema Update Summary

## ‚úÖ Changes Completed

### 1. Updated Index Schema in "Create Index" Tab
**File:** `/Users/robenhai/agentic-rag-demo/agentic-rag-demo.py`

**Change:** Made the `url` field filterable and searchable in the `create_agentic_rag_index()` function:

```python
# Before:
SimpleField(name="url", type="Edm.String"),

# After:
SimpleField(name="url", type="Edm.String", filterable=True, searchable=True),
```

### 2. Updated SharePoint Purger to Use Efficient Filtering
**File:** `/Users/robenhai/agentic-rag-demo/connectors/sharepoint/sharepoint_deleted_files_purger.py`

**Change:** Updated filter queries to use `search.ismatch()` for better performance:

```python
# Before:
search_filter = "url ne null and contains(url, 'sharepoint.com')"

# After:
search_filter = "url ne null and search.ismatch('sharepoint.com', 'url')"
```

## üîÑ Next Steps Required

### IMPORTANT: Recreate Your Index

Since we've updated the schema, you need to recreate your existing index to get the new filterable `url` field:

1. **Open the Streamlit app:** Run `streamlit run agentic-rag-demo.py`
2. **Go to the "Create Index" tab**
3. **Delete your existing index** (use the "Manage Index" tab if needed)
4. **Create a new index** with the same name using the "Create Index" tab
5. **Re-index your SharePoint content** using the SharePoint tab

### After Recreating the Index

Once you have an index with the new schema:

1. **Test the SharePoint purger** in the SharePoint tab
2. **Use "Preview Purge"** to see which files would be deleted
3. **Use "Purge Deleted Files"** to actually remove deleted SharePoint files from the index

## üéØ Expected Benefits

### Improved Performance
- **Efficient filtering:** The purger now uses Azure Search's native filtering capabilities instead of retrieving all documents
- **Faster execution:** Only SharePoint documents are retrieved and checked
- **Reduced memory usage:** No need to load the entire index into memory

### Better User Experience
- **Faster preview:** See which files would be deleted almost instantly
- **Faster purging:** Delete operations complete much more quickly
- **More reliable:** Proper filtering reduces the chance of errors

## üß™ Testing the Changes

A test script has been created at `/Users/robenhai/agentic-rag-demo/test_index_schema_update.py` to verify the filtering works correctly.

**Run the test:**
```bash
cd /Users/robenhai/agentic-rag-demo
/Users/robenhai/agentic-rag-demo/.venv/bin/python test_index_schema_update.py
```

**Expected results:**
- With old index: Filter will fail (url field not filterable)
- With new index: Filter will succeed and show SharePoint documents

## üîç Verification Checklist

After recreating your index:

- [ ] Index created successfully with new schema
- [ ] SharePoint content re-indexed successfully  
- [ ] Preview purge shows expected deleted files
- [ ] Actual purge removes deleted files from index
- [ ] No errors in the SharePoint tab
- [ ] Test script shows successful filtering

## üö® Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Filter errors:** Make sure you've recreated the index with the new schema
2. **No SharePoint documents found:** Verify SharePoint content was re-indexed
3. **Permission errors:** Check all SharePoint environment variables are set correctly
4. **Search errors:** Try the test script to verify index schema

## üìù Technical Details

### Index Schema Changes
The `url` field is now:
- **Filterable:** Can be used in `$filter` queries
- **Searchable:** Can be used in full-text search operations

### Filter Query Evolution
1. **Original:** Retrieved all documents, then filtered in Python (slow)
2. **Previous:** Used `contains()` function but field wasn't filterable (failed)
3. **Current:** Uses `search.ismatch()` with proper filterable field (fast and reliable)

### Fallback Logic
The purger includes fallback logic:
1. Try `search.ismatch()` first (most efficient)
2. Fall back to `contains()` if needed
3. Fall back to other field types if `url` not available
4. Clear error messages if no suitable fields found
