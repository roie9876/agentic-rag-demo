# Reports Refresh Fix - No More Full Page Reloads

## Problem
The "Refresh Reports" button was causing a full page reload using `st.rerun()`, which would refresh the entire Streamlit application and potentially switch tabs, creating a poor user experience.

## Solution
Implemented a session state-based refresh mechanism that only updates the reports data without triggering a full page reload.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main UI (`agentic-rag-demo.py`)

**Before:**
```python
if st.button("ðŸ”„ Refresh Reports"):
    st.rerun()  # This caused full page reload
```

**After:**
```python
if st.button("ðŸ”„ Refresh Reports"):
    # Use session state to trigger reports refresh without full page reload
    if "reports_refresh_counter" not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.reports_refresh_counter = 0
    st.session_state.reports_refresh_counter += 1
    st.success("Reports refreshed!", icon="âœ…")
```

### 2. Reports Loading Logic

**Before:**
```python
reports = scheduler.get_reports()  # Always loaded fresh
```

**After:**
```python
# Initialize reports refresh system
if "reports_data" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.reports_data = None
    st.session_state.reports_last_refresh = 0

# Check if we need to refresh reports data
current_refresh_counter = st.session_state.get("reports_refresh_counter", 0)
if (st.session_state.reports_data is None or 
    current_refresh_counter > st.session_state.reports_last_refresh):
    # Load fresh reports data
    st.session_state.reports_data = scheduler.get_reports()
    st.session_state.reports_last_refresh = current_refresh_counter

# Use cached reports data
reports = st.session_state.reports_data
```

### 3. Delete Operations

Updated both individual report deletion and "Delete All Reports" to invalidate the cache:

```python
# After successful deletion
st.session_state.reports_data = None
if "reports_refresh_counter" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.reports_refresh_counter = 0
st.session_state.reports_refresh_counter += 1
```

### 4. SharePoint UI (`ui_sharepoint.py`)

Applied the same fix to the SharePoint interface:

```python
if st.button("ðŸ”„ Refresh Reports", use_container_width=True):
    self.reports.load_reports()
    if "ui_reports_refresh_counter" not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.ui_reports_refresh_counter = 0
    st.session_state.ui_reports_refresh_counter += 1
    st.success("Reports refreshed!", icon="âœ…")
```

## How It Works

1. **Caching**: Reports are stored in `st.session_state.reports_data`
2. **Refresh Counter**: A counter tracks when refresh is requested
3. **Smart Loading**: Reports are only reloaded when the counter changes
4. **No Page Reload**: No `st.rerun()` calls for refresh operations

## Benefits

- âœ… **No Full Page Reload**: Users stay on the current tab
- âœ… **Better Performance**: Reports are cached and only reloaded when needed
- âœ… **Improved UX**: Smooth refresh experience with success message
- âœ… **Consistent Behavior**: Works the same way in both main UI and SharePoint UI
- âœ… **Proper Cache Invalidation**: Delete operations correctly update the cache

## User Experience

**Before:** 
- Click "Refresh Reports" â†’ Entire page reloads â†’ User might lose their current tab/scroll position

**After:**
- Click "Refresh Reports" â†’ Only reports section updates â†’ User stays exactly where they were â†’ Success message confirms the action

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the implementation:
```bash
python test_refresh_no_reload.py
```

Or test manually:
1. Start the application: `python agentic-rag-demo.py`
2. Navigate to the "Scheduled Indexing" tab
3. Click "ðŸ”„ Refresh Reports"
4. Notice that:
   - The page doesn't reload
   - You stay on the same tab
   - A green success message appears
   - The reports list is updated

## Future Considerations

This pattern can be applied to other refresh operations in the application to improve the overall user experience by avoiding unnecessary full page reloads.
